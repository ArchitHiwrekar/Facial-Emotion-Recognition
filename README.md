# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
The objective was to classify faces based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories of basic human emotions. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was built in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions as a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data

Program is trained for 15 epochs and runs at 63% accuracy.
